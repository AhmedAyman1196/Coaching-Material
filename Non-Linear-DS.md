# Non-Linear DS
---
## Outline
1. Balanced Binary Search Tree (Java TreeMap/TreeSet)
	 1. Difference between a map and a set.
	 2. Creating TreeMaps and TreeSets.
	 3. Important functions and their complexity:
	 	* `add, remove, contains, getValue`
	 4. How it works internally.
	 5. Creating a comparator for an object to be the key in a TreeMap/Set.
	 6. Traversing a TreeMap, TreeSet.
	 7. Tricks and Pitfalls.
	 	* Example : Wrong comparat
	 
2. Heap (Java PriorityQueue)
	 1. Creating PriorityQueues.
	 2. Important functions and their complexities:
	 	* `add, poll, peek`
	 3. How sorting is done internally + sorting complexity.
	 		
3. Hash Table (Java HashMap/HashSet)
	1. Creating PriorityQueues.
	2. Important functions and their complexities.
	3. HashMap/Set vs TreeMap/Set.
	4. Creating Hash functions and avoiding collisions.
